The park itself is quite small (I was really expecting something grand   even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small).The food options are good, few coffee shops (including Starbucks) and plenty of gift shops.

Unfortunately, by the third day we had to rush to see everything, so I would suggest three nights and four days to do and see all.

This consisted of a nice bath with separate toilet area from the shower tub, a large room with TV and 2 double beds, plus a smaller room with bunk beds and a 2nd TV. The rate was reasonable and included unlimited entry to the park. Also included was a wonderful breakfast. The service was fantastic.

There is a nice walk to the disneyland parks and boardwalks. It takes around 20 mins on foot.We are revisting Disneyland paris resort in 2004, I would like to stay at this hotel, very friendly and helpful.

       "386069177  5       2016-4      United States      Every time I enter the gates to Disneyland, I feel happy.  I must have been to Disneyland well over 200 times over the past 50 years but, somehow, it makes my happiness increase.  Last week was no exception.  However you do this Disney people, please...More                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Disneyland_California    0.000023\n",
       "1398724    5       missing     United States      Disnyeland has to be the BEST place to take a family for a wonderful vacation or just a day of fun! It is safe, clean & takes you back to a simpler time. I have visited Disneyland at least 50 times & never tire of it or the magic it gives to everyone. When you step onto Main Street you see what Walt saw evertime he was there. Look up over the Fire House & that was Walt's apartment for when he stayed at the park. There is a light on in the window which meant that Walt was in the park, when he was alive. That light is left on all the time now to remind the cast members & visitors that Walt will always be with us & is always  in the park . To best enjoy the park go at off peak times. Summer & holidays are notoriously busy & the lines for all the rides will be long. Waiting an hour to ride Dumbo does not make anyone happy! If you must go at these times of year get an early start on the day. The park will usually open at least 20 30 minutes early on the busy days. You can get in early to also shop along Main Street before they  drop the rope  to enter the  Lands . If you are staying at one of the Disney hotels (I highly recommend the Grand Californian if you can afford it) your purchases can be sent to your room at no charge, a great deal so that you don't have to carry bags around all day.  1 rule, have some sort of a plan. This will save time deciding which ride to go to next. It is best to try to ride the  big rides  as early in the day as possible. Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain are all rides that can be a very long wait later in the day. One of the best ideas Disney has come up with is the Fast Pass. Use this to avoid some of the lines later in the day. First thing in the morning ride 1 or 2 of your favortite rides then go to get a Fast Pass for another ride to ride later. You can only have 1 Fast Pass at a time. Once you have hit the time for your current Fast Pass you can get another one. For example, if you have a Fast Pass for Indiana Jones at 11:30   12:30 you can go get another Fast Pass for another ride (or the same one) at 11:30, before you even ride the ride. The machines only know you have one up to the beginning time, after that they don't recognize you have one. Another tip, you can ride that ride any time after the beginning time, so if your Pass says come back between 11:30   12:30 you can ride anytime the rest of the day after 11:30. You are not limited to just the one hour it states. The parades are geat entertainment but getting a good spot for viewing takes someone staking out a place at least 45 minutes to an hour (some people will go even earlier) before the parade starts. One of their best shows is Fantasmic. If you want to splurge, book a seat on the Disney Gallery balcony ahead of time (call Guest Relations before you even get to Disney, up to 30 days in advance). The current price is $40 which includes a dessert buffet, a drink & your most perfect seat to watch the show. Pricey but you don't have to stake out a place 1 2 hours in advance. For young kids Fantasyland will be there first stop. Dumbo & Peter Pan are the rides that usually are the longest wait during the day. Ride those first if possible. One underrated ride is the Storybook Land Canal Boats. This is a very serene ride to see the miniature towns of the characters made famous by Disney. The details in the miniature villages are wonderful. It is especially fun at night. Another fun land for the little ones is Toontown. The rides are all (except for Roger Rabbit) scaled for the smaller visitors. There are lots of fun things to do in this land such as blow things up (at least it sounds like you are blowing things up!) & breaking out of jail. The Roger Rabbit ride is great fun for the whole family. One great place for kids to burn off steam & adults to find a shady place to rest is Tom Sawyer Island. Mom & Dad find a bench to relax on while the kids explore the caves & climb the rocks. A great place to get rid of any extra energy after standing in long lines. Teenagers will enjoy the big roller coaster rides like Splash Mountain (yes, you will get wet), Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Star Tours & Indiana Jones. They may even enjoy the corny Jungle Cruise ride with all it's great jokes by the  captians  of the boats. Mad Tea Party in Fantasyland is also a favortite of teens just to see who can get their teacup to spin the fastest. Adults who have grown up with Disney all their lives will enjoy everything it has to offer. A good way to learn more & find out some behind the scenes facts is to take the  Walk in Walt's Footsteps  tour. Interesting & full of fun facts. Look for all the things that make Disneyland special. The care & attention that is given to the smallest details are what make this a very magical place indeed!  Disneyland_California    0.000023\n",
